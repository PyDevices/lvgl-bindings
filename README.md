# lvgl-bindings

LVGL header-to-C binding generator for MicroPython, CircuitPython, and CPython.

## The LVGL family

This repo owns the binding tags and generated sources used by the downstream LVGL repos, and is
the canonical description of how the family fits together:

- **lvgl-bindings** (this repo) — generates the C bindings (`generated/lvgl_*.c`, `lvgl.pyi`) from
  the LVGL headers for all three targets, and owns the release chain.
- **[lvgl-python](https://github.com/PyDevices/lvgl-python)** — the publishing endpoint. Turns
  synced bindings into versioned `pydevices-lvgl` wheels on TestPyPI. It is the only repo in the
  family that publishes a package.
- **[lvgl-circuitpython](https://github.com/PyDevices/lvgl-circuitpython)** and
  **[lvgl-micropython](https://github.com/PyDevices/lvgl-micropython)** — consumer/build repos.
  They consume the generated bindings and rebuild their own CircuitPython / MicroPython targets,
  but do not publish their own packages to TestPyPI.

Every other repo in the family links back to this section rather than repeating it.

**SINGLE WRITER**: `python/` helpers, `lv_conf.h`, and the generated bindings under `generated/`
are edited **only here**. Consumer repos sync these files in; any edits made directly in a
consumer repo get silently overwritten by the next sync. See
["Releases and propagation"](#releases-and-propagation) below.

## Documentation

- [Using LVGL with PyDevices](https://github.com/PyDevices/pydevices/blob/main/docs/lvgl.md) (in PyDevices/pydevices,
  beside `display_driver`) — how the three sister projects fit together, and
  what `display_driver` does.
- [Loading fonts at runtime](docs/fonts.md) — `fonts/*.bin` and
  `python/fs_driver.py`: any built-in font without a firmware rebuild.
- [Generator architecture](docs/generator-architecture.md) — canonical model,
  policy, target lowering, parser pin, and validation invariants.
- [Generator migration](docs/generator-migration.md) — clean-break command and
  artifact changes from the pre-rebuild generator.
- [docs/](docs/) — the full index.

What's planned next is in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Layout

```
lvgl-bindings/
  binding/              # Modular Python generator (binding.generate is the entry point)
  lvgl/                 # LVGL submodule (git submodule update --init)
  lv_conf.h             # Shared LVGL config for all targets
  generated/            # Generated bindings, API model, and shared stub (committed)
  python/               # Hand-written helpers (fs_driver.py — committed)
  packages/             # Optional MIP manifests

```

## Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PyDevices/lvgl-bindings.git lvgl-bindings
cd lvgl-bindings
git submodule update --init lvgl
```

The consumer repos don't need this clone beside them: each one's `scripts/sync_from_lvgl_bindings.sh` fetches an exact commit from GitHub, and `LV_BINDINGS_REPO` points it at your own clone or fork instead.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

The runtime generator dependency set is available separately through
`requirements.txt`; `requirements-dev.txt` also installs the pinned test and
static-checking tools used by the validation commands below.

## Typical workflow

The practical flow is: make a small change in **`binding/`** or the LVGL submodule, regenerate the binding target you need, sync the generated files into the consumer repo, and then rebuild that repo’s firmware or extension. If you only touched the Python-side glue, start with **`python/fs_driver.py`** and the consumer sync script (LVGL's PyDevices coordinator, `display_driver.py`, is in PyDevices/pydevices and ships without a bindings release); if you changed the C API surface or LVGL headers, regenerate the relevant target first and rebuild the consumer before trusting the result.

## Generate bindings

Regenerate after changing `lvgl/`, `lv_conf.h`, or `binding/`, then commit the updated files under `generated/`:

```bash
./regenerate_all.sh                    # all targets
./regenerate_all.sh --target micropython
./regenerate_all.sh --target circuitpython
./regenerate_all.sh --target cpython
./regenerate_all.sh --pyi-only         # shared stub only
./regenerate_all.sh --check --hash     # read-only reproducibility check, same gate release uses
```

`regenerate_all.sh` is the primary entry point; it never commits, tags,
pushes, or dispatches a release. Under the hood it calls the underlying
generator directly:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python -m binding.generate
```

Use `-m binding.generate` directly only when you need flags the wrapper
doesn't expose, such as `binding.api_report`:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python -m binding.api_report generated/api.json \
    --baseline docs/baseline/lvgl-bindings-api-baseline.json.gz \
    --classification docs/baseline/lvgl-bindings-api-baseline-classification.json \
    --format markdown
```

The unified command preprocesses LVGL once and writes the selected target C
source, the target-neutral `api.json`, shared `lvgl.pp`, the CircuitPython
generated header, and the shared `lvgl.pyi`. The API model is
hashed and includes visibility and target availability; deliberate exceptions
are recorded in `binding/api_policy.json`. Preprocessing removes compiler line markers so the
inputs are reproducible across checkout paths. The command's `--check` mode
generates into a temporary directory and never changes the working tree.

The shared stub is generated exclusively from the canonical
`generated/api.json` model. Use `--pyi-only` when changing typing emission so
the C bindings, canonical API model, and preprocessed input are not
regenerated. The public names are the single established upstream-compatible
profile; the rebuild intentionally has no alternate naming mode.

`binding.api_report` validates the canonical model and reports qualified export
counts, common-target coverage, target availability exceptions,
inheritance-expanded object APIs, generated target-artifact hashes, and the
diagnostic projection against the historical baseline.

All targets receive the same parsed declaration IR, canonical API model,
context-local generation state, conversion discovery, inheritance order,
registration plan, and diagnostics policy. MicroPython and CircuitPython share
the `mp_obj_t` native lowering because CircuitPython embeds the same object API;
target registration and VM/GC lifecycle mechanics remain in target glue.
CPython lowering is native `PyObject *` code with its own GIL/lock and module
initialization glue. Target emitters may choose different C representations,
but they do not choose different public declarations.

```bash
./scripts/verify_bindings.sh  # Read-only checks
```

After regen, rebuild the consumer repo(s) (`lvgl-micropython`,
`lvgl-circuitpython`, `lvgl-python`) as usual.

## `display_driver`

The coordinator that wires LVGL to a PyDevices `board_config` (display flush,
input devices and the `multimer` event loop) is `display_driver.py` in
[PyDevices/pydevices `lib/`](https://github.com/PyDevices/pydevices/blob/main/lib/display_driver.py).
It ships with `pydevices` because it needs `appdev`, `events`, `keys` and
`multimer`; the bindings don't, so you can use them with plumbing of your own.
[Using LVGL with PyDevices](https://github.com/PyDevices/pydevices/blob/main/docs/lvgl.md) covers what it does.

## Consumers

| Repo | Role & Sync |
|---|---|
| [lvgl-micropython](https://github.com/PyDevices/lvgl-micropython) | MicroPython C module: `generated/lvgl_micropython.c`, `lvgl/`, `lv_conf.h`, `python/fs_driver.py` → `lib/` |
| [lvgl-circuitpython](https://github.com/PyDevices/lvgl-circuitpython) | CircuitPython tree patches: `generated/lvgl_circuitpython.c`, `generated/lvgl_circuitpython.h`, `lvgl/`, `lv_conf.h`, `python/fs_driver.py` → `lib/` |
| [lvgl-python](https://github.com/PyDevices/lvgl-python) | CPython extension & TestPyPI wheel publisher: exact-commit `generated/lvgl_python.c`, `generated/lvgl.pyi`, `lvgl/`, `lv_conf.h`, and helpers (see [releasing-bindings.md](docs/releasing-bindings.md)) |

Each consumer records the resolved source SHA in `LVGL_BINDINGS_COMMIT`.
Consumer sync scripts reject branch names so downstream builds cannot silently
move to a different generator or artifact set.

## Releases and propagation

This repo publishes **source tags, not wheels or GitHub Releases** — an empty
Releases sidebar here is deliberate, not a broken pipeline.

Releases are explicit, never automatic:

1. `./scripts/publish_release_tag.sh --push` (or with an explicit version) cuts and pushes an
   annotated `vX.Y.Z` tag. Pushing the tag does not trigger anything by itself.
2. Someone then dispatches `release.yml` with `publish=true` for that tag/SHA, which validates
   the source across all three consumers and, only then, tells `lvgl-python` to sync and publish.

**Merging to `main` releases and propagates nothing.** Consumers do not track `main`; each pins an
exact `LVGL_BINDINGS_COMMIT` and only moves forward when its own sync is run against a specific
commit or release tag. Of the family, only `lvgl-python` publishes a package (`pydevices-lvgl` on
TestPyPI); `lvgl-micropython` and `lvgl-circuitpython` rebuild from the synced files but publish
nothing themselves.

See [releasing-bindings.md](docs/releasing-bindings.md) for the full release chain.
